# Water Potability Classification

The aim of this project is to accurately distinguish potable water from nonpotable water, based on 9 different water measurements. A challenge for this dataset is the high number of missing values and the relatively low number of features.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability).

:construction: This project is still under construction and will be finished in about a week or so.
