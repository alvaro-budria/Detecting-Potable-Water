# Water Potability Classification

The aim of this project is to detect potable water source, based on 9 different water measurements. A challenge for this dataset is the high number of missing values and the relatively low explanatory power of the features.

The dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability).
